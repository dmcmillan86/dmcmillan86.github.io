# I’m David, a **B.S. in Data Analytics** graduate with over **17 years of industry experience across telecommunications, security, and utility services**. I build practical solutions at the intersection of data, automation, and systems—turning complex, real-world problems into clear insights, reproducible processes, and outcomes we can actually use.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

Below are three projects I’m most proud of right now. Each includes a short overview and a link to the repo.

---

### 1) **Turning Churn into Opportunity**
**Do contract terms have an impact on customer churn?**

### Summary

This project applies statistical analysis to a real telecommunications dataset to determine whether customer contract type is significantly associated with churn behavior. Using a Chi-Square Test of Independence and Cramér’s V effect size, the analysis demonstrates that month-to-month customers churn at substantially higher rates than long-term contract customers.

The focus of this project is on statistical rigor, reproducibility, and clear business interpretation rather than immediately defaulting to machine learning.

### Highlights

- Cleaned and prepared ~7,000 customer records for analysis
- Constructed contingency tables for categorical comparison
- Performed Chi-Square statistical testing with assumption validation
