# I’m David, a **B.S. in Data Analytics** graduate with over **17 years of industry experience across telecommunications, security, and utility services**. I build practical solutions at the intersection of data, automation, and systems—turning complex, real-world problems into clear insights, reproducible processes, and outcomes we can actually use.

### 1) **Turning Churn into Opportunity**
**Do contract terms have an impact on customer churn?**

### Summary

This project applies statistical analysis to a telecommunications dataset to determine whether customer contract type is significantly associated with churn behavior. Using the Chi-Square Test of Independence and Cramér’s V effect size, my analysis demonstrates that month-to-month customers churn at substantially higher rates than long-term contract customers.

The focus of this project is on statistical rigor, reproducibility, and clear business interpretation.
